    <p style="font-family: Lucida Console; font-size: 22.5px;"><b>Description:</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;">We use continuous and discrete phase-type distributions to investigate problems in "last-mile delivery" - problems involving deliveries into (sub)urban areas from depots. In modelling single loading zones as retrial queues with continuous phase-type retrials and service times fitted from real data - we utilise simulations to examine stationary distributions, waiting times, and other performance measures. These parameters are then used by us to characterise single loading zones and inform route planning decisions within an urban logistics network. We model such a network as a doubly weighted graph of transition probabilities and travel costs. Where travel costs include both individual loading zone waiting times and travel times between loading zones. We then take the perspective of discrete phase-type distributions to establish weighted expected absorption times, which represent the time it takes to complete a courier's assigned deliveries. Within this framework, we discuss delivery strategies, route optimization, and its potential in addressing other problems. </p>
